## 💎 General purpose
This software, with a simple click, is capable of causing a crisis and challenge in the network of any large or small organization. It is actually designed for penetration testing, security assessment, and ethical hacking. Since Windows-based software often lacks the necessary functionality, we have developed this tool specifically for Windows users and hackers who prefer working with Windows.

## 🙏 The reason for using the name "Condor" in the software's name

The software **Abdal DHCP Condor** is named in honor of **Kevin Mitnick**, one of the most renowned hackers and cybersecurity experts in history. The name "Condor," which Mitnick earned due to his extraordinary skills in infiltrating computer systems, inspired me in choosing this name for the software. With this naming, I wanted to pay special respect to his legacy and the profound impact he had on the world of cybersecurity. Mitnick was not only a legendary hacker but also served the community as a prominent security consultant and author after his time in prison. As someone who deeply respects his career, I proudly named this software after him.
